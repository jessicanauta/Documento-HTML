    <blockquote>
    <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been ateadily
        improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from 
        Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbsite Thai.
        Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
        and authentis Thai food at a reasonable price.we think
        Curbside Thai food at a reasonable price. We think 
        Curbsite Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
        the streets of Charlotte./p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
            and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the 
            convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbsite Thai you 
            don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
            master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
            Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
            Food Cart Was and we couldn't be happier.</p>
